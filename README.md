# hello-world
Exercise for creating a basic public repository.

> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Proin gravida ullamcorper volutpat. Nullam finibus nisi id dolor euismod, vel maximus ante commodo. Proin fringilla ipsum et cursus sagittis. Nam maximus lobortis orci in euismod. Pellentesque ullamcorper, eros quis vehicula ultricies, leo est eleifend lacus, ac cursus quam orci et risus. Vestibulum ante ipsum primis in faucibus orci luctus et ultrices posuere cubilia curae; Etiam hendrerit ac dui ac laoreet. Phasellus aliquet neque metus, in laoreet massa aliquam nec. Donec et augue vitae lorem elementum laoreet nec at ex.

Where did that come from?

> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

Here is a horizontal rule

---

And text after it.

## Heading 2
This is an exercise for using **github** to create a public repository. I am pulling examples from [a Markdown cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

### Heading 3
This may be *left active* for further testing, or *deleted* to keep my list of public repositories clean.

Ordered list:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

Unordered list:

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

## Example code formatting

Let's see what this looks like:

`code`

And this does not work

`library(tidyverse)

x <- c(1:10)
y <- mean(x)`

Instead use a "Fenced code block"

```
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```

### An image derail and paths

Upload an image later.

![Alternate text](image.jpg)

Recommended use of relative paths, for example: [Relative path test (MD file)](./testfolder/relative-path-test.md)

### A table

| Syntax | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header | Title |
| Paragraph | Text | 

Here's a sentence with a footnote.<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>

<b id="f1">1</b> This is the footnote (but needs to be created manually, and pay attention to the connections via IDs). [â†©](#a1)

### Heading with an ID {#custom-id}

term
: definition

~~The world is flat.~~
